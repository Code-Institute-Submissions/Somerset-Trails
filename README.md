# Somerset Trails
### Explore the west country's best trails, one step at a time.

*Somerset is world famous for it's beautiful countryside and spectacular hill-top views with thousands of tourists flocking to visit the area every year. Somerset boasts trails such as the **Cheddar Gorge**, the **Weston Woods**, **Somerset Coastal path** and many more.*

### UX
-----

__Somerset Trails__ website offers a user **(see user stories below)** a visually impactful site through its application of a responsive slideshow on each trail and a Google maps feature enabling the user to toggle between distance and terrain types to suit their own personal needs. 

* The primary goal of this website is to be a responsive, that users can easily explore different trails and learn more about each location.

* The site should be easy to navigate, the menu bar follows viewer on each page so the user won't have to scroll up to access different sections of the site.

* Map of each trail is to be clearly defined on each page, and easy to use the toggles: terrain and distance.

### User Stories
-----

*"As a local businessman whom lives in the area, websites that display Somerset trails are hard to look at with far too many adverts. I'd like the website to be beautiful to view like the trails, with little to no advertising."*

---

*"My name is Grant, I don't like websites that are too text heavy and I lose interest quickly because of this I would like the site to have lots of images and only have text where it is necessary as I feel images tell a greater story."*

---

*"Hey, my name is Jeremy a product owner for this site. I do not like when a site looks great on desktop but looks crowded& cluttered on a mobile device as I view alot of websites via my mobile so I would like the site to be pleasurable to view on mobile devices."*

---

*"Good afternoon, my name is Helen a code editor. I would like the website to be easy to navigate, as it's a pain having to scroll back to the top of each page every time I want to access a different part of a website."*

### Strategy 
-----

* Firstly I had to establish target audience, somerset has popular holiday sites such as: Butlins, Haven sites, glamping& camping sites on the quantock hills, Kittisford& Barton and luxury cottages in the rolling hills. 
This shows that the countryside is a glamorous& viable getaway for many families so having a responsive& intuitive website can display these amazing trails and the location of them is very important.

* New locals to Somerset can also benefit as getting to know the area is an important part of settling into a new area; so a visually pleasing site would make a good impression and encourage user to explore the area further. And lastly there are many local people who have lived in Somerset for years and have never explored these trails; implementing a Google maps API raises awareness of these trails to those potential users.

### Scope
-----
The next problem I had to solve was that there was already a great website called: https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/ - so what could I offer that is different? 
Users that come to this site aren't looking for trails in Wales or the north of England, this sites scope is specifically aimed towards users who either are local or users who are visitting the Somerset area. 

So the next step was figuring out how to maximise the user experience and present the best of Somerset trails via images& google maps API.
